# Wordle-Solver

## About the Project

### Overview
Wordle Solver is an advanced Python-based tool designed to optimize guesses in the popular Wordle game. By analyzing letter frequencies and positions within five-letter words, this algorithm achieves an impressive average of 3.67 guesses per game. Utilizing a recursive strategy, the solver systematically refines and eliminates word options, efficiently honing in on correct answers.

### Features
- **Optimal Guess Computation:** Calculates the most strategic guesses based on letter frequency and positional data.
- **Recursive Solution Narrowing:** Implements a recursive method to progressively eliminate non-viable word options after each guess.
- **Performance Metrics:** Tracks and displays performance statistics, including average guesses per game.
